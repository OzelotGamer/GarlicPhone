Garlic Phone is a Gartic Phone plugg-in.
It removes Ads and adds customizability to the Game.


I'm bad at programming so if its bad: I KNOW!

There Currently isn't much because i just started, but soon more will come.

Tutorial on how to add this to your game:

First create a Bookmark.
Edit the bookmark and set the name to: Garlic Phone
(or basically anything you can remember)
Then set the URL to the following:
```javascript
javascript:(function(){var s = document.createElement("script"); s.src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OzelotGamer/GarlicPhone/main/GarlicPhone.js"; document.body.append(s); s.onload = function(){start();}})();
```
